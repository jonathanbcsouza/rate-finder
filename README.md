My solution to check what package the user will need after choose dimensions.
Packages so we've placed an upper limit of 25kg per package abd dimensions limits are below.

| Package Type | Length | Breadth | Height | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 200mm | 300mm | 150mm | $5.00 |
| Medium | 300mm | 400mm | 200mm| $7.50 |
| Large | 400mm | 600mm | 250mm | $8.50 |

## Features ##
The app when supplied the dimensions (length x breadth x height) and weight of a package, advise on the cost and type of package required. If the package exceeds these dimensions - or is over 25kg - then the service not return a packaging solution.
